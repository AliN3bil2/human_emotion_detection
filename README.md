Description:

In this project, I developed a Facial Expression Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
to accurately classify facial expressions in images into seven different categories: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.
The dataset used for training and testing consisted of facial images from the CK+48 dataset,with a total of 981 samples.

Results:

Test Accuracy: Approximately 99.5%
Test Loss: 0.0277
